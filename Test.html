	<a href="mailto:antoinette@gallifrey.foundation, t.reiterer@sharkproject.org?subject=Email Subject&body=Recently we have drawn to the attention of your airline (and the three major airline alliances) to the increased legal and reputational risks associated with the transport by air freight of shark fins and other shark-related products such as meat and skin. In the last 30 years shark populations have plummeted by 80%. The IUCN lists at least two thirds of sharks as vulnerable or threatened. You may be aware of recent changes to the laws in different jurisdictions - with more to come:US President Biden signed into law on 23 December 2022 legislation on the US Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act which prohibits the import and export of trade in shark fins.Also in 2022, CITES party members voted to limit or regulate the commercial trade in 54 shark species which are the most targeted for the fin trade - along with other species. Collectively, these now place 90% of all shark species traded globally for their fins.On Dec 14 2022, Austria agreed to ban the import of all commercial shark products.On Friday 25 March, the second hearing took place in the UK House of Commons on the Shark Fin Sales (Banning) Bill. This follows the third reading in the House of Lords on 10 February. You have the power to make a positive change for sharks by committing to a ban on the transport of shark products and adopting a shark fin cargo policy that prohibits the transportation of shark fins and other shark products.">Click here to send email</a>
